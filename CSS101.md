# CSS 101

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**, CSS is the "proper" way to control
the appearence of your web pages.

## Linking a CSS Stylesheet to an HTML Document

Stylesheets are often kept in seperate documents to simplify the maintenence of
a web site – for sites with a single page, this doesn't matter much, but for
sites with dozens of files it really helps.

In the ```<head>``` section of your HTML document include a ```<link>``` tag
that looks like this:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="the_name_of_your_file.css">

A common name for the CSS file is the name of the project.

## CSS Syntax

CSS files consist of **selectors** and **declarations**.

In their simplest form selectors are the names of the HTML elements that your
wish to style.
The declarations consist of **properties** and their associated **values.**

Here is an example:

    h1 {
    	color: blue;
    	font-size: 20px;
    }

In this example ```h1``` is the selector. There are two declarations,
one for property ```color``` and one for the property```font-size```.
The value of color is ```blue```, for font-size it is ```20px```.

### Selectors: linking CSS and HTML

CSS uses **selectors** to identify the HTML that will be styled. The simplest
selector is the name of an HTML tag, for example h1.
Done like this the declaration applies to **all** h1 tags in the document.

More complex selectors, allow you to specify a particular "hunk" of HTML that
you want to style.

#### Class (.xyz)

Target multiple (presumably related) elements in a document, for example an
item in a list.

    <ul>
      <li class="notice">Blah, blah, blah.</li>
      <li class="notice">And, blah, blah, blah.</li>
      <li class="warning">Really important blah blah.</li>
    </ul>

    .notice { color: orange; }
    .warning { color: red; }

#### Id (#xyz)

Target a single, unique element in a document – good to avoid if you can, useful
for finding "a needle in a haystack."

#### Descendant (X Y)

Target only elements Y within element X. For example, you could syle all of the
anchor tags within lists with this selector:

    li a {
      /* Target anchor tags in lists. */
      text-decoration: none;
    }

#### Direct or Immediate Descendants (X > Y)

Targets element Y when it is immediately preceded by element X.

#### Adjacent (X + Y)

Target element Y if it comes immediately after item X.

#### Pseudo Selectors (X:visited)

Target elements that have a particular state, for example a link that has been
visited.

The selector X:checked, for exmple, will select a item like a radio button or
checkbox that has been checked.

#### Attributes Selector (X[y])

Select element X if it has the attribute y.

#### Pseudo Element Selector (X::element)

    p::first-line {
      font-weight: bold;
    }

    Select a "pseudo-element" of a block level element.
